# Getting Started with MedBridge React Web App
To get started you're gonna want to start up the backend where the model is first so:
- cd backend 
-.\venv\Scripts\activate
then install these necesities if you haven't already 
-pip install flask flask-cors transformers torch sentencepiece evaluate 
then:
-python app.py 
and the backend should be running now, then open another terminal and cd to frontend and simply:
-npm start
The speech (Enquire by Voice button) will just allow you to use whatever mic you have (**THIS ONLY WORKS ON GOOGLE CHROME**) and transcribe whatever medical sentence you decide you want to translate such as " I need to get medicine "
# If I remember to add anything else I will
